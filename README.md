### What I learned

This was my first Frontend Mentor project and I was able to get finish it fairly quickly. I think what I learned is that I am more comfortable with HTML and CSS than I may have thought that I was. I was also able to troubleshoot. This was also the first time I've built something from an image (in this case a Figma file) and that was actually very refreshing.

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) - The flexbox used in this project was very basic, but I did enjoy going through Flexbox Froggy the other day. It was a fun way to reinforce concepts that I had learned.
